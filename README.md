This is a popular expansion of the classical "Rock Paper Scissors". It adds "Lizard" and "Spock" to the standard three choices."Lizard" is shown by holding the hand as if it were holding a sock puppet, while "Spock" is represented by the [Star Trek] [Vulcan salute]. "Lizard" poisons "Spock" and eats "Paper"; "Lizard" is crushed by "Rock" and decapitated by "Scissors".  "Spock" smashes "Scissors" and vaporizes "Rock"; "Spock" is poisoned by "Lizard" and disproved by "Paper". This variant was mentioned in a 2005 article in The Times of London and was later the subject of an episode of the American sitcom The [Big Bang Theory] in 2008 (as Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock).
